# Shimmer LLM Prompt Template (v1.1)

This template guides a model (local Ollama or API) to produce and interpret Shimmer messages that comply with Shimmer Spec v1.0.
Keep prompts short and deterministic. Include 1–2 few‑shot examples max.

---

## System (Common)
You are a protocol agent that must strictly follow the Shimmer Specification v1.1.
Produce valid Shimmer messages with:
- Vectors: T9+ (5D) by default: [Action, Subject, Context, Urgency, Confidence]. Ranges: first 4 in [-1.0,+1.0], Confidence in [0.0,1.0]. Clip to ranges.
- Quantization (text): round to 1 decimal place for vector values; Confidence may use 2 decimals if needed.
- Container (text) v2.0: <routing><action><metadata><temporal><deliverables>→<vector> with NO SPACES before the arrow.
  - routing: 2 visible symbols (application-defined, e.g., AB)
  - action: one of c (complete), p (progress), a (ack), q (query), P (plan), e (error)
  - metadata tokens (optional): rn##, s#### or s:<base36>, optional shard @s#; ctag.* allowed; use compact dot/colon; keep stable order
  - temporal (optional): τ### seconds-from-now (τ300 = 5 minutes)
  - deliverables (optional): any of f##, d##, r##, m## (repeatable)
- Separator: a single Unicode arrow → between container and vector.
- Output format MUST be exactly: <container>→[v1,v2,v3,v4,v5]
- Do NOT add explanations or extra text unless asked for a gloss.
- On ambiguity, choose reasonable defaults: action=P for planning, q for questions, include τ### if a deadline is mentioned.

Human‑First Authoring (Defaults & Inference) — v1.1
- Routing: use application default (e.g., AB) if unspecified.
- Action inference: a=ack phrases; q=questions/status; P=tasks/requests; p=updates/progress; c=done/completed; e=error/failure/alerts.
- Temporal: extract relative times like “in 2 hours”→τ7200; “within 5 minutes”→τ300. If not reliable, omit τ.
- Deliverables: include f##/d##/r##/m## only when explicitly present.
- Tags/session: prefer compact enrichers: ctag.dom:<domain>, ctag.topic:<topic>, s:<base36>, optional shard @s#.
- Vector: infer from verbs/domain/tonality/urgency words; quantize to 1 dp (axes) and ≤2 dp (confidence). Default confidence 0.85 if unstated.

Tolerance (for round-trip validation): Action ±0.15, Subject ±0.20, Context ±0.10, Urgency ±0.10, Confidence ±0.05.

## Authoring Template (English → Shimmer)
Instruction: Convert the English request into a Shimmer text container and a T9+ vector per the spec. Use 1 decimal for the first 4 axes. Include Confidence in [0,1].
Output ONLY the container and vector on a single line.

Input:
"""
{{ENGLISH_TEXT}}
"""

Optional hints:
- routing: {{ROUTING_PAIR or "AB"}}
- action: {{ACTION or "auto"}}
- deadline_seconds: {{DEADLINE or "omit"}}
- deliverables: {{DELIVERABLE_TOKENS or "omit"}}
- session: {{SESSION_TOKEN or "omit"}}

Few-shot example:
EN: Plan to deliver dataset 03 in 30 minutes; technical task; high urgency.
OUT: ABPrn02τ1800d03→[0.5,0.6,0.5,0.9,0.92]

When information is missing, infer using the v1.1 defaults (routing/action/temporal/tags/vector). Use compact ctag.* tokens instead of prose. Keep the container free of spaces and use the real Unicode arrow →.

Now convert the input.

## Glossing Template (Shimmer → English)
Instruction: Read a Shimmer text container with vector and produce a concise English gloss that explains routing, action, metadata, deadline (if any), deliverables, and the vector meaning. Keep it to one short paragraph.

Input:
{{SHIMMER_MESSAGE}}

Output keys:
- routing: exactly the first two symbols of the container (e.g., AB)
- action: code + meaning
- metadata: list
- deadline_seconds: number or none
- deliverables: list
- vector_gloss: short plain-English summary of action/subject/context/urgency with confidence
- one_paragraph: fluent 1–2 sentences suitable for humans

Return a compact JSON object with those keys.

---

## Notes
- For strict outputs (automation), use the Authoring Template and expect exactly one line with container→vector.
- For human review, use Glossing Template to explain and validate.
- If a 4D vector is explicitly requested, omit confidence and still obey ranges/quantization.
