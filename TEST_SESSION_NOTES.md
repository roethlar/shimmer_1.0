# Test Session Notes - 2025-08-18

## Test Scenario
- Monitoring live agent coordination in `/mnt/home/sourcecode/current/SkippyTM/coord.sjl`
- Two agents (Œª, ŒΩ) coordinating via Shimmer protocol
- Mix of text containers and binary T9p containers

## Findings

### Text Container Translation - ‚úÖ Working
Successfully translated text containers:
- `ŒªŒΩPskippyœÑ28800f01‚Üí[0.8,0.7,0.1,0.9,0.95]` - Plan with 8hr deadline
- `ŒΩŒªpskippyœÑ1800f02‚Üí[0.5,0.6,0.1,0.5,0.90]` - Progress report, 30min deadline  
- `ŒªŒΩQskippyœÑ1800datacheck‚Üí[0.2,0.8,0.1,0.8,0.92]` - Query for datacheck
- `ŒΩŒªadatacheck‚Üí[0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.5,0.92]` - Acknowledgment
- `ŒΩŒªPctag.rules.v1.lowercase_actions‚Üí[0.5,0.6,0.5,0.5,0.92]` - Planning ctag rules
- `ŒªŒΩqskippyf02status‚Üí[0.3,0.8,0.1,0.8,0.94]` - Status query

### Binary T9p Translation - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Success
#### Line 6: `QwOaaKORO0AATMwMzUAA5g==`
- **Decoded successfully:** agent 1‚Üí0, session 12345, priority 10, vector [0.5,0.6,0.1,0.5,0.902]
- **Text equivalent:** `ŒΩŒªa‚Üí[0.5,0.6,0.1,0.5,0.902]`
- **Translation:** Nu acknowledges with moderate technical action, internal context, timely urgency

#### Line 8: `QQhgOK0ROUAMTBOMAD5Q==`  
- **Decode failed:** Only 15 bytes instead of required 16 bytes
- **Issue:** Truncated binary container or encoding error

## Protocol Efficiency Assessment
‚úÖ **Very efficient inter-agent communication observed:**
- High information density in compact format
- Clear handoff patterns (plan‚Üíprogress‚Üíquery‚Üíack‚Üínew planning)
- Confidence levels show agent certainty states
- Temporal constraints prevent runaway processes
- Mix of text/binary shows optimization in practice

## Critical Gaps Identified

### üö® Major Issue: Incomplete T9p Support
**Problem:** Current tooling cannot decode binary T9p containers reliably
- shimmer-cli only handles text containers
- Manual bit-level decoding implemented during test but needs proper tooling
- Binary transmission errors (Line 8 truncation) not detectable without decoder

**Impact:** Cannot provide complete coordination monitoring when agents use binary format

## TODO Items

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement complete T9p binary decoder in tools/
- [ ] Add binary container support to shimmer-cli 
- [ ] Create coord.sjl monitoring tool with auto-translation
- [ ] Add binary transmission error detection and recovery

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Agent symbol mapping registry (text routing ‚Üî 2-bit codes)
- [ ] Session tracking for multi-agent coordination
- [ ] Parity validation for binary containers
- [ ] Round-trip validation tools

### Low Priority
- [ ] Real-time coordination visualization
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Confidence trend analysis

## Test Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Text container translation working perfectly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Binary translation partially working (1/2 containers decoded)
- ‚úÖ Protocol efficiency validated in practice
- ‚ùå Complete monitoring capability blocked by binary decoding gaps

## Next Steps
1. Implement robust T9p decoder with error handling
2. Add --binary flag to shimmer-cli for mixed-format streams
3. Create dedicated coordination monitoring tool
4. Test with longer coordination sessions
